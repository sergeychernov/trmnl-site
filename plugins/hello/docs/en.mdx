# Hello

The **“Hello”** plugin shows a personalized greeting and the current time for a chosen time zone on your TRMNL device.  
It’s a simple default screen for a home or office device where you want to immediately see **what time it is** and **who this device is configured for**.

## What it does

- **Personalized greeting**  
  Uses the user name from global settings (`name`) to render a human‑friendly greeting.
- **Current time**  
  Displays local time based on the configured time zone (`timeZone` field in plugin settings).
- **Layout that adapts to any size**  
  Rendered as a React component and automatically adapts to the block size.

## Key settings

- **Time zone (`timeZone`)**  
  - IANA format, e.g. `Europe/Moscow`, `Europe/Berlin`, `America/New_York`.  
  - Defines which local time will be displayed to the user.
- **User name**  
  - Taken from TRMNL global user settings (`name`).  
  - If the name is empty, the greeting falls back to a more generic variant.

## Typical use cases

- Home TRMNL at the apartment entrance — quick greeting and current time.
- Office desk device — shows the time and the person this device belongs to.
- Demo / test screen for first BYOS device experiments.

## Limitations and notes

- The plugin **does not call any external APIs** and does not use database data — only user and plugin settings.
- Make sure to configure a **valid IANA time zone** for correct time display.
