# School schedule

The **“School schedule”** plugin shows a weekly timetable on your TRMNL device: days of the week, lesson numbers, subject names and start/end times.  
It’s a digital replacement for a paper schedule — useful for students, parents and teachers.

## What it does

- **Displays a weekly timetable**  
  Weekdays (Monday–Saturday) with lessons in order.
- **Shows lesson times**  
  Based on a shared list of lesson start times (`lessonStarts`) and a single lesson duration (`lessonDurationMin`).
- **Fully configurable per class**  
  Each day has its own list of subjects: from empty days to a fully packed schedule.

## Key settings

Settings type: `ScheduleSettings`.

- **Time zone (`timeZone`)**
  - IANA format, e.g. `Europe/Moscow`.  
  - Used to calculate current time and correct display of lesson times.

- **Lesson duration (`lessonDurationMin`)**
  - Integer number of minutes, e.g. `45`.  
  - Used to calculate each lesson’s end time.

- **Lesson starts (`lessonStarts`)**
  - Array of strings in `HH:MM` format, shared for all weekdays.  
  - Example: `["08:30", "09:25", "10:30", ...]`.  
  - The length defines the maximum number of lessons in a day.

- **Show times (`showTimes`)**
  - `true` — timetable shows start/end time for each lesson.  
  - `false` — only lesson numbers and subject names.

- **Per‑day schedule (`schedule`)**
  - `mon`, `tue`, `wed`, `thu`, `fri`, `sat?` — arrays of strings with subject names.  
  - Examples:
    - Monday: `["Math", "Russian language", "History", "English"]`
    - Tuesday: `["Literature", "PE", "Physics", "Crafts"]`
  - An empty array means “no lessons that day”.

## Typical use cases

- TRMNL near a student’s desk to see “what lessons are today and when they start”.
- Family TRMNL with a child’s weekly schedule visible to both parents and kids.

## Limitations and notes

- The plugin **does not call any external APIs** — all data is configured manually in settings.
- Make sure that:
  - all `lessonStarts` values are valid `HH:MM` strings,
  - all `schedule.*` arrays contain strings only (subject names).
- The number of subjects in a day should not exceed the length of `lessonStarts`,  
  otherwise extra lessons will not be correctly mapped to times.
