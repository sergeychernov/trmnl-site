# Telegram

The **Telegram plugin** turns your TRMNL into a personal display for Telegram messages. Send text via the bot, and it instantly appears on your device screen.

## What it does

- **Displays messages from Telegram**  
  Shows the latest message sent via the TRMNL bot to this device.
- **Supports Markdown formatting**  
  Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, inline code, links, and lists.
- **Adjustable font size**  
  5 text size levels from "very small" to "very large".
- **Timestamp display**  
  Shows the date and time of the last message at the bottom of the screen.

## Getting started

1. **Link your Telegram account**  
   - Go to your user profile on the TRMNL website.
   - Click "Link Telegram" and follow the instructions.
   - Send the bot the linking code with `/start <code>`.

2. **Select the Telegram plugin**  
   - In device settings, choose the "Telegram" plugin.
   - Adjust the font size to your preference.

3. **Send messages**  
   - Write any text to the bot — it will appear on the screen.
   - Edit messages — the screen will update automatically.

## Bot commands

- `/start <code>` — link account to TRMNL
- `/devices` — list of your devices with Telegram plugin
- `/help` — command help

## Formatting support

The plugin correctly displays Telegram formatting:
- **Bold text** — `**text**`
- *Italic* — `*text*`
- __Underline__ — `__text__`
- ~~Strikethrough~~ — `~~text~~`
- `Monospace` — `` `code` ``
- [Links](https://example.com) — `[text](url)`

## Settings

- **Font size (`fontScale`)**  
  - -2: Very small
  - -1: Small  
  - 0: Normal (default)
  - +1: Large
  - +2: Very large

## Common use cases

- **Reminders and notes** — send yourself important information via Telegram.
- **Family display** — family members can leave messages for each other.
- **Notifications from other services** — set up forwarding of important messages.
- **Motivational quotes** — update inspiring text every day.

## How it works

- The plugin uses the `replace` strategy — only the latest message is shown on screen.
- If you have multiple devices with the Telegram plugin, the message will be sent to all of them.
- When editing a message in Telegram, the screen updates automatically.
- Maximum message length is limited by screen size and chosen font.

## Security

- Messages are stored in TRMNL's secure database.
- Only you can send messages to your devices.
- Account linking happens through a unique one-time code.
